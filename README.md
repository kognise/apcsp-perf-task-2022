# APCSP Performance Task 2022

The first real program I remember ever writing in Java was an implementation of Conway's game of life. I'm not in school but in 2022 I took the APCSP and APCSA exams in large part because I was curious how I would fare on standardized testing of computer stuff.

For the APCSP Create performance task, I realized I could make an implementation of Conway's game of life perfectly fit the requirements, so I did that. It was certainly fun picking up Java again :)

Pushing this (very small amount of) code to GitHub in an effort to cut down on the amount of unpublished code I have lying around.
